# Balance-Run
Hyper-Casual Game Project Developed by https://github.com/ErenKumru & https://github.com/munircan at UDO Games Summer Internship

# About The Project
I was assigned to develop a hyper-casual game for mobile platforms from scratch. So, I started thinking about something new and never done before. 
After some research, I found out that trying to balance a physically accurate moving tower was never done at the time. Thus the project started.
The idea of Balance Run is completely my own and developed by me and another intern https://github.com/munircan.
We developed the game, optimized it and made it ready for CPI and CTR tests. Test results were good enough to inspire the UDO Games.

# About The Game
Playing as a rugby team captain, players run from start to finish line and tries to build a human tower by collecting cheerleaders while trying to dodge obstacles using swerve mechanics.
Also, the higher the cheerleader tower becomes the harder it gets to balance the tower. But, at the end the higher the tower gets the more points the player is rewarded.
